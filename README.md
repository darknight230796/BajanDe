# BajanDe
I developed a music player android app, named Bajan Do, dedicated to haryanvi folk audience. The application was programmed in Java. Firebase Realtime Database was used to store data related to songs and artists, as it was common for all users. the app also provided user signin options using Facebook, Google or Phone number. Authentication was handled using Firebase Authentication.

Further basic requirements from a music player, such as offline mode, playlists, stations and many more, were also been provided in the app. The app also stored user preferences and favourites in local storage using android Room database.
